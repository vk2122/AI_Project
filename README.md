# Medical-Health-Diagnosis
<h1>Problem Statment</h1>
<b>The proposed project would be very useful in the medical field. In the proposed project a machine learning- based web application would be created for medical diagnosis. For a medical diagnosis, a machine learning model would be developed and integrated with the created web application. The user would be able to upload his medical data on the web application. The web application would pass this data to a developed machine learning model for health disease detection. After detection of health disease, if the person wants to take advice from a doctor then he can fix the appointment on the web application. A chat(Email) option would be provided on the web application to provide the communication between the patient and the doctor.</b>
<h1>Why this Project?</h1>
<b>Although, we know that humans can do the mistakes but machines doesnt. Plus we can check the predicted outcome accuracy with machine learning. So we go for Machine learning, Keeping this in mind we researched alot in the allopathic, homeopathy and ayurvedic data. Due to less research paper for the data set of patients in homeopathy and ayurvedic we go for allopathic data set that are avalible in Kaggle and UCI machine learning portals.</b>
<h1>Diseases Predicted:</h1>
<b> 1. Breast Cancer Detection<br>
    2. Brain Tumour Detection</b>
